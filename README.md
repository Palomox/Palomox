### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Lucy. I enjoy coding, I discovered it some years ago. The only language I'm fluent with so far is Java, but im looking forward lo learn others especially Rust.
One of my interests is web development. My last project is [cutepigeons](https://cutepigeons.palomox.ga) which is a simple application with a spring boot backend and vue3 frontend for getting images of some pigeons.

I've also worked on Minecraft server plugins. One of the projects I've been working on is HoPoke, an organization with future Minecraft server plans, and managing Minecraft servers and coding plugins for them is what brought me to coding. 

My latest plugin is [LucyBlocks](https://github.com/Palomox/LucyBlocks), a simple plugin to play Lucky blocks on a paper server.
