### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Palomox. I enjoy coding, I discovered it some years ago. The only language I know by the moment is Java, but im looking forward lo learn others specifically I'm interested on C and JS.

Lately I've been working on Minecraft server plugins. One of the projects I've been working on is HoPoke, an organization with future Minecraft server plans, and managing Minecraft servers and coding plugins for them is what brought me to coding. 

My latest project is UHCLebrel, a plugin made for hosting UHC Competitions in Minecraft:
