### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hello, I'm Palomox. I enjoy programming, i discovered it some years ago. The only language I know by the moment is Java, but im looking forward lo learn new langs like C or JS. Lately I've been working on Minecraft server plugins. I'm the owner of HoPoke, an organization with future Minecraft server plans, and managing minecraft servers and coding plugins for them is what brought me to coding. 
My latest project is UHCLebrel, a plugin made for hosting UHC Competitions in Minecraft:
